Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDepth Anything V2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DV-LORA\u9002\u914d\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u53cd\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53cd\u5149\u3001\u5145\u6ee1\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8584\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u900f\u660e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528Depth Anything V2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d(DV-LORA)\u5c06\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5230\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff1b3. \u5728SCARED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u53cd\u5149\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728SCARED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6(<1.25)\u8fbe\u523098.1%\uff0c\u5e73\u65b9\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc717%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u53cd\u5149\u624b\u672f\u7167\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Depth Anything V2\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548cDV-LORA\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u53cd\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback.

Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c060.2-2\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u7684T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210CT\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9885\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u6982\u7387\u70ed\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86MRI\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u9885\u9aa8\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "CT\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u513f\u7ae5\u9885\u9aa8\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u7578\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7535\u79bb\u8f90\u5c04\u5bf9\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u3002MRI\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u4e14\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u9885\u9aa8\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u9aa8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6216\u9885\u9876\u751f\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u83b7\u53d6CT\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210CT(sCT)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u6982\u7387\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u70ed\u56fe\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210CT\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eCT\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fbe99%\uff0cFrechet inception\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a1.01\u3002\u9885\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u9885\u9aa8\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a85%\uff0c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe80%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7TOST\u68c0\u9a8c(p<0.05)\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86sCT\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eCT\u5728\u9885\u9aa8\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u4eceMRI\u884d\u751f\u7684\u5408\u6210CT\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u513f\u79d1\u9885\u9aa8CT\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1MRI\u5bf9\u9aa8\u9abc\u548c\u7f1d\u5408\u7ebf\u7684\u663e\u793a\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u5e38\u89c4\u513f\u79d1MRI\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\u5408\u6210CT\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u9885\u9aa8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively.

These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u663e\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b092.4%\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c85.5%\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u591a\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6a21\u5757AI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u548cDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3) \u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u672f\u624b\u52bf\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u572858\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e27\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523092.4%\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523085.5%\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u663e\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo.

Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model.

We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors.

Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries.

We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \\textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \\textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features.

The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u4eceRPO\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u672a\u77e5\u822a\u5929\u56683D\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6539\u5584\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u822a\u5929\u5668\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f20\u7edf3DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u592a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u822a\u5929\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u592a\u7a7a\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473DGS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u7684\u592a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3aRPO\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f"}}

However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CVC\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u901f\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u901f\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63(CVC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7531\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u5148\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u652f\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u63a7\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u652f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u548cTweedie\u6821\u6b63\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u3002", "result": "CVC\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCVC\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "CVC\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u901f\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON.

However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise.

However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation.

However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization.

Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality.

We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts.

Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u5230\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2) \u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u8bca\u65ad\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoBench\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u7ea7\u522b\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u56de\u6eaf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7TrustGeoGen\u751f\u6210\u516d\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5982OpenAI-o3\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528MLLMs\uff1b2) \u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b3) \u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u524d\u63d0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b4) \u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u610f\u5916\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoBench\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faD\u00b2-Align\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u66dd\u5149\uff09\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6821\u6b63\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51bb\u7ed3\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u6821\u6b63\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0cD\u00b2-Align\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00b2-Align\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "IMDD-1M\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b100\u4e07\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d660\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\u548c400\u591a\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u6765\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b100\u4e07\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u7684IMDD-1M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u52305%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "IMDD-1M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines.

Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere\" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks.

While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaSeg\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884cMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDIM\uff09\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RGB\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u989c\u8272\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMambaSeg\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884cMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDIM\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08CSIM\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08CTIM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDD17\u548cDSEC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMambaSeg\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaSeg\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884cMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86RGB\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to \"regression-to-the-mean\", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility.

However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.", "AI": {"tldr": "DualityForge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DNA-Train\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u5e38\u8bc6\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u672a\u63a5\u5730\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDualityForge\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u548cQA\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfQA\u5bf9\u53ca\u539f\u59cb-\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efaDualityVidQA\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b4\uff09\u63d0\u51faDNA-Train\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFT-RL\uff09\uff0c\u5728RL\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u2113\u2081\u4f18\u52bf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728DualityVidQA-Test\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534724.0%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DualityForge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLM\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360\u00b0 closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360\u00b0 panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5168\u666f\u62fc\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7b49\u8ddd\u5706\u67f1\u6295\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684360\u00b0\u5168\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u5dee\u548c\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u91cd\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u75282D\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5171\u9762\u6216\u89c6\u5dee\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\uff08\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u548c\u906e\u6321\uff09\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5f71\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c360\u00b0\u95ed\u73af\u62fc\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u52a0\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\uff1b2. \u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u8ddd\u5706\u67f1\u6295\u5f71\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u5168\u666f\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b3. \u5728\u753b\u5e03\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u586b\u5145\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u70b9\u8f6c\u6362\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u91cd\u5f71\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u666f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u62fc\u63a5\u4ece2D\u53d8\u5f62\u8303\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u5404\u79cd3D\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing.

Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions.

This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "CERES\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6307\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61-\u52a8\u4f5c\u914d\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CERES\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff1a1\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u540e\u95e8\u8c03\u6574\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u524d\u95e8\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u539f\u5219\u6307\u5bfc\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u667a\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5bf9\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5931\u771f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego-RVOS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCERES\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CERES\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6307\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making.

To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783).

While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5360\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6574\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5360\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u63013D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms.

Donoho", "Marcelle Altshuler", "Omar Arnaout"], "title": "AI-Driven Evaluation of Surgical Skill via Action Recognition", "comment": null, "summary": "The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684TimeSformer\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u548cYOLO\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u624b\u672f\u6280\u80fd\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe93.62%", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u672f\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u672f\u6027\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8eTimeSformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u672f\u8868\u73b0", "result": "\u572858\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u5e27\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u738787.7%\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u81f393.62%\uff1b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u590d\u5236\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe76%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u624b\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898"}}

We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362(DWT)\u5206\u6790Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u5c42DWT\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e3aViT\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5bf9Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u7d22Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362(DWT)\u83b7\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u91cd\u6784\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u5c42DWT\u5206\u89e3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660eViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5c0a\u91cd\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3ViT\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5177\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u662f\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3ViT\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(F2IDiff FM)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(T2IDiff FM)\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8(\u226512MP)\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf(<1MP)\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(F2IDiff FM)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6444\u5f71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528DINOv2\u7b49\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408YOLO\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86YOLOv5\u548cYOLOv8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u4ecd\u9700\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528YOLOv5\u548cYOLOv8\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u603b\u7ed3\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cdYOLO\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "YOLOv5\u548cYOLOv8\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bAI\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aGPT-4\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff084.88/5\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5199\u4f5c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff082.81/5\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6587\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4ecd\u6709\u533a\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision.

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SliceLens\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u548cVLM\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6FeSD\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u504f\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSliceLens\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u548cFeSD\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSliceLens\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728FeSD\u4e0a\u5c06Precision@10\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.42\uff080.73 vs. 0.31\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SliceLens\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cVLM\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FeSD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM.

It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization.

However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86FireRescue\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u51faFRS-YOLO\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c71\u533a\u6216\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bf9\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b2) \u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\u6709\u9650\uff08\u5982\u706b\u7130\u3001\u70df\u96fe\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8986\u76d6\u6307\u6325\u51b3\u7b56\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u9632\u8f66\u3001\u6d88\u9632\u5458\uff09\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86FireRescue\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u5c71\u533a\u3001\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u6c34\u57df\u591a\u79cd\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u542b8\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\u517115,980\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c32,000\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u63d0\u51faFRS-YOLO\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u5f15\u5165\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u524d\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u70df\u96fe\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86YOLO\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u6307\u6325\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization.

Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Project Page: https://unic-lift.github.io/", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance.

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias.

Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.", "AI": {"tldr": "CropTrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u51b3\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5173\u8054\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u5149\u7167\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9891\u7e41\u5f3a\u906e\u6321\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u800c\u519c\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u5916\u89c2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5916\u89c2\u5173\u8054\u96be\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCropTrack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a1\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5173\u8054\uff1b2\uff09\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5173\u8054\u914d\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u539f\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5e93\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u519c\u4e1aMOT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCropTrack\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bc6\u522bF1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5173\u8054\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8eab\u4efd\u5207\u6362\u6b21\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "CropTrack\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8eab\u4efd\u3002"}}

However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities.

While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u9632\u6b62\u6743\u91cd\u6f02\u79fb", "motivation": "3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u4e9a\u6d32\u3001\u6b27\u6d32\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u9632\u6b62\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6f02\u79fb", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd"}}

Tao Fang (Corresponding Author), Lina Lu (Co-corresponding Author)", "summary": "Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u975e\u95e8\u63a7\u80f8\u90e8CT\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9499\u5316\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u662f\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u53d7\u5fc3\u810f\u548c\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u95e8\u63a7\u5fc3\u810fCT\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u95e8\u63a7\u80f8\u90e8CT\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u4f46\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u975e\u95e8\u63a7CT\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9499\u5316\u75c5\u7076", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProDM\uff08Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09CAC\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ece\u5fc3\u810f\u95e8\u63a7CT\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u975e\u95e8\u63a7\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u9499\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u878d\u5165\u9499\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProDM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CAC\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u75c5\u7076\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u975e\u95e8\u63a7\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9eProDM\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027", "conclusion": "ProDM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4ece\u5e38\u89c4\u80f8\u90e8CT\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760CAC\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking.

Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline.

Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRFL-ReID\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u517c\u5bb9", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u793a(Bi-C2R)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RFL-ReID\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f20\u7edfL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "RFL-ReID\u662f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfL-ReID\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cBi-C2R\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898"}}

Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u97f3\u4ece\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DiT\u751f\u6210\u7406\u60f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u97f3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u60f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\u2014\u2014\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec5\u5507\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f3a\u5931\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u540c\u6b65\u5507\u90e8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Diffusion Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u5408\u6210\u5507\u90e8\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u4f34\u751f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\uff1b2) \u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u5507\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51faContextDubBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u97f3\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7406\u60f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.
